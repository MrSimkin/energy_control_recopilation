# Solar of Things Windows App — Continuity / Resume Status

Date: 2026-09-25
Status: PHASE 1 — REFINED BUILD CI PASS / FINAL USER REVALIDATION PENDING

This file is the canonical continuity note.

## Repository / branch

- Repository: `MrSimkin/energy_control_recopilation`
- Canonical branch: `main`
- Pre-refinement HEAD: `fe8e319fbe4470a5eae260a44706dd20325d4bc7`
- Original formal CI validation run: `36085763308`
- Original validated source commit: `778abaab896d6e211fdc658aa56e80bb6947e7bd`

## Completed and still authoritative

- Solar of Things / SiSeLi public/API research through Round 14.
- Product/functional specification v1, subject to the approved 2026-09-25 language change note.
- .NET 10 / C# / WPF x64 architecture.
- separate Core library.
- SQLite + WAL + migration foundation.
- SQL-backed non-secret settings.
- portable/installed path strategy.
- JSONL diagnostics.
- Windows DPAPI secret-store abstraction.
- GitHub Actions Windows build/smoke/publish workflow.

Do not repeat this foundation unless evidence shows a regression.

## Original Windows 11 manual checkpoint — PASS

On 2026-09-25 the user tested the original portable development artifact on the actual Windows 11 x64 target machine.

Confirmed:
- shell launched and rendered correctly;
- normal launch did not require UAC/elevation;
- application closed normally;
- `Data\\energy.db` was created;
- `Backups\\` was created;
- `Logs\\` was created;
- JSONL diagnostics were created;
- displayed database path was the portable `...\\Data\\energy.db` path;
- SmartScreen unknown-publisher warning was expected for the unsigned development build.

The user had manually selected Run as administrator on an earlier launch; its UAC dialog was user-initiated and is not evidence of an application elevation requirement.

## Approved requirement change — 2026-09-25

Earlier files correctly record the former instruction that the UI be English.

The user has now explicitly changed the canonical requirement:

**Spanish is the default UI language. English is selectable as an alternative.**

The preference must persist locally.

Historical requirement files remain historical and should not be rewritten to pretend this was always the requirement.

Current product name `Solar Energy Monitor / SolarEnergyMonitor` is provisional.

**Final product name = TBD.**

## Refined Phase 1 build — CI PASS

Implementation commit:
- `ee8e8200f132be9aef42875c6ae92eb1f10adc66`

GitHub Actions:
- workflow: Windows Build
- run ID: `36171030035`
- conclusion: **SUCCESS**

Fresh portable artifact:
- name: `SolarEnergyMonitor-win-x64-dev`
- artifact ID: `10881030047`
- SHA-256 digest reported by GitHub: `4389db735ab205698c014bc97e505191b0601ad2075988f926ef441642281cde`
- source commit: `ee8e8200f132be9aef42875c6ae92eb1f10adc66`

Validated by CI:
- .NET 10 restore;
- WPF Release build;
- existing SQLite smoke test;
- self-contained win-x64 publish;
- portable-mode marker;
- artifact upload.

## Current narrow Phase 1 refinement

Implement only:

1. reusable WPF localization infrastructure;
2. Spanish default;
3. English selectable and persisted through application settings;
4. localization of the current shell;
5. minimal real sidebar navigation between distinct placeholder sections;
6. no fabricated telemetry.

Implementation and CI are complete. Perform one short user revalidation of artifact ID `10881030047`:

- opens normally without UAC;
- Spanish appears by default on a fresh database;
- language can switch to English and back;
- chosen language persists after restart;
- each sidebar item visibly navigates to its distinct placeholder;
- database path remains portable;
- application closes normally.

If all pass, record **PHASE 1 COMPLETE**.

## What has NOT started

Phase 2 has not started.

Do not implement yet:
- Solar of Things authentication;
- token/session handling;
- station discovery;
- device discovery;
- telemetry download;
- historical backfill;
- target-device commissioning.

## Resume rule

Continue from the narrow Phase 1 refinement/final revalidation only. Do not restart research, specification, or validated infrastructure.
