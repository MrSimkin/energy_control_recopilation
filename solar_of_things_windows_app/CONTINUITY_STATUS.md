Do not repeat this foundation unless evidence shows a regression.

## Original Windows 11 manual checkpoint — PASS

On 2026-09-25 the user tested the original portable development artifact on the actual Windows 11 x64 target machine.

Confirmed:
- shell launched and rendered correctly;
- normal launch did not require UAC/elevation;
- application closed normally;
- `Data\\energy.db` was created;
- `Backups\\` was created;
- `Logs\\` was created;
- JSONL diagnostics were created;
- displayed database path was the portable `...\\Data\\energy.db` path;
- SmartScreen unknown-publisher warning was expected for the unsigned development build.

The user had manually selected Run as administrator on an earlier launch; its UAC dialog was user-initiated and is not evidence of an application elevation requirement.

## Approved requirement change — 2026-09-25

Earlier files correctly record the former instruction that the UI be English.

The user has now explicitly changed the canonical requirement:

**Spanish is the default UI language. English is selectable as an alternative.**

The preference must persist locally.

Historical requirement files remain historical and should not be rewritten to pretend this was always the requirement.

Current product name `Solar Energy Monitor / SolarEnergyMonitor` is provisional.

**Final product name = TBD.**

## Refined Phase 1 build — CI PASS

Implementation commit:
- `ee8e8200f132be9aef42875c6ae92eb1f10adc66`

GitHub Actions:
- workflow: Windows Build
- run ID: `36171030035`
- conclusion: **SUCCESS**

Fresh portable artifact:
- name: `SolarEnergyMonitor-win-x64-dev`
- artifact ID: `10881030047`
- SHA-256 digest reported by GitHub: `4389db735ab205698c014bc97e505191b0601ad2075988f926ef441642281cde`
- source commit: `ee8e8200f132be9aef42875c6ae92eb1f10adc66`

Validated by CI:
- .NET 10 restore;
- WPF Release build;
- existing SQLite smoke test;
- self-contained win-x64 publish;
- portable-mode marker;
- artifact upload.

## Final refined-build user revalidation — PASS

On 2026-09-25 the user revalidated artifact ID `10881030047` on the target Windows 11 x64 machine and reported **all checks passed**:

- normal launch without UAC;
- Spanish shown by default on a fresh portable database;
- English switching works;
- English preference persists after restart;
- switching back to Spanish persists after restart;
- every sidebar entry visibly navigates to its distinct placeholder;
- portable database remains at `...\\Data\\energy.db`;
- clean shutdown.

**Phase 1 is formally COMPLETE.**

Canonical closure receipt:
`PHASE_01_ACCEPTANCE_RECEIPT.md`.

## Current development frontier

Phase 1 is complete.

Phase 2 has been validated against the user's real production account far enough to establish:
- normal account/password login using the built-in production client profile: PASS;
- station discovery: PASS;
- device discovery/details: PASS;
- gather-attribute discovery: PASS;
- `dataSource=1` live-state validation: PASS;
- energy-flow read: PASS;
- daily aggregate read: PASS;
- commissioning-profile persistence: PASS;
- remembered session/reconnect after restart: PASS;
- evidence-backed server logout: PASS.

The live report exposed one shared protocol mismatch in history + alarm queries: fractional-second ISO timestamps were rejected by production as invalid `fromTime`. That wire format was corrected to station-local `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:sszzz`. Its final production verification is intentionally folded into the next Phase 3 live test rather than spending a separate user test cycle.

Phase 3 raw-data ingestion is now **IN PROGRESS**.

Implemented Phase 3 foundation:
- SQLite schema v4 raw-history corpus;
- raw `device + attribute + actual source timestamp` storage;
- explicit null/missing preservation;
- raw API-page capture;
- per-local-day completeness/audit state;
- selected-key history ingestion;
- `record/list` fallback for any incomplete selected-key day;
- local-day timezone-aware windows;
- page size **300** for both raw-history endpoints;
- stop on short page or positive page-count `total`, with bounded safety cap;
- actual returned timestamps only — no synthetic five-minute grid;
- daily median/p90/max gap metrics from real timestamps;
- idempotent upsert;
- initial lower bound from real device `installedAt` metadata when available;
- incremental reread overlap from the newest locally stored timestamp;
- sync-run audit;
- core progress/cancellation support;
- `Actualizar datos` wired to the history-ingestion engine.

Canonical data rule:
Solar of Things raw telemetry is commonly around five-minute cadence, but cadence is not exact. The collector must persist every real timestamp, preserve gaps/nulls, and never fabricate missing 5-minute rows or integrate power using a fixed 5-minute multiplier.

## Current combined Phase 2/3 live-test candidate — CI PASS

Windows Build:
- run ID: `36186838776`
- source commit: `57f9b8b2912b5834edff7355f49d1566f3606bd6`
- conclusion: **SUCCESS**

Portable artifact:
- name: `SolarEnergyMonitor-win-x64-dev`
- artifact ID: `10887225685`
- SHA-256: `fb7dc54e3255a5494d82ea32f1dbde5b3fcaa5be40aacc8a1b61fc2079681ee7`

This candidate contains:
- timestamp-corrected Phase 2 history/alarm probes;
- Phase 3 schema v4 raw corpus;
- daily station-local raw-history ingestion;
- 300-frame pagination;
- selected-key primary history + record/list fallback;
- first-backfill cross-source comparison;
- idempotent persistence;
- actual-timestamp gap metrics;
- retry of historical PARTIAL days;
- visible progress bar;
- safe Stop/Detener preserving already committed data;
- hard request budget + pacing + rate/auth/server circuit breakers;
- automatic bounded start range based on device installation/local continuity;
- manual start-date override;
- Phase 3 status shown in the desktop shell.

The next real-PC run is intentionally a **combined Phase 2/Phase 3 acceptance/development test**:
1. authenticate/reconnect normally;
2. use the timestamp-corrected commissioning probes;
3. run `Actualizar datos`;
4. attempt daily backfill from the device installation date through today;
5. inspect the resulting diagnostic/sync evidence and local corpus;
6. correct any live pagination/shape/retention mismatch found.

## Installation-specific family manual integrated — 2026-09-25

The user supplied the family-specific manual:

`Manual_Familiar_SPRO_6200_LC230_Midea_v2_ES.docx`

Source metadata:
- edition: v2.0;
- manual date: 2026-08-14;
- SHA-256: `f519a39be14950258ce51d3cbb3a7e69cbc6b23769b2ae9e47c77ca71f5a3bde`;
- user confirms the manual's recommended inverter changes are currently applied.

Canonical repo integration:
- `INSTALLATION_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md`;
- `MANUAL_FAMILIAR_INTEGRATION_REVIEW_2026-09-25.md`;
- `reference/FAMILY_MANUAL_SOURCE.md`.

Roadmap effect:
- no phase renumbering;
- Phase 4 is now installation-aware before generic analytics;
- current configuration becomes a read-only behavior/compliance contract;
- battery UI must distinguish stored energy, ordinary-use energy above 20%, emergency 20→10% reserve and protected 10% floor;
- grid use while recovering from 20% toward 50% can be expected;
- current policy expects solar-only battery charging;
- zero export is an invariant;
- seasonal analysis may move load timing but must not automatically change protection thresholds;
- known 1.5 kW Midea heater schedule is contextual metadata, not a new control integration.

Important protected/unknown areas:
- exact firmware remains unknown;
- exact CT/zero-export meter topology remains unknown;
- second AC output is observed enabled but its physical circuit mapping remains unknown;
- grid profile/CT/BMS/protection writes remain outside application scope.

The manual **does not invalidate Phase 3 raw history**. It improves interpretation. Versioned normalization can be rebuilt locally without another historical cloud download.

Phase 4 work already underway before this manual remains useful, but battery semantics and behavior classification must follow the installation contract before the Battery page is finalized.

## Phase 4 installation-aware implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-25

Implemented and CI-compiling:

- schema v7 configuration-health snapshot;
- local read-only installation behavior evaluator;
- HPVINV02 normalization rule v2 with AC grid voltage;
- evidence-based latest household operating-state classifier;
- real Battery page with 20% / 10% / 50% family-manual semantics;
- Home plain-language operating explanation;
- Data & Updates read-only inverter configuration-health summary.

These views use local raw/normalized data and do not add background Solar of Things polling.

The next substantive target-PC validation should verify this combined Phase 4 tranche together; do not ask for a separate micro-test for each individual UI/card change.

## Resume rule

Resume with **Phase 3 raw-history ingestion continuing independently while Phase 4 installation-aware normalization advances**.

Immediate development order:
1. use `INSTALLATION_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md` as the target-house interpretation authority;
2. keep Phase 3 raw data immutable/auditable and continue filling missing history as needed;
3. add read-only configuration/baseline interpretation and drift states;
4. finish normalized target-device metrics;
5. correct/finalize Battery UI around 20% normal reserve, 10% outage floor and 50% recovery/restart semantics;
6. only then expand aggregation/statistics and broader household analysis.

Do not perform another micro-test merely for manual integration. The next target-machine test should validate a substantive combined tranche.

Do not restart completed API research, Phase 0 specification, or Phase 1 architecture/localization/navigation work unless a concrete regression or implementation-time evidence requires a narrow correction.
